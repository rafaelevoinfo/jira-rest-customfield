# Jira Rest Values Plugin - Data Security and Privacy

This plugin stores no data itself, it only allows to access
data from a rest endpoint is fetched but never stores anywhere. 
It is the responsibility of whoever configures the plugin for a particular JIRA installation to ensure there is no 
problem regarding security and privacy.
